				Program Description
			</h1>
			<p>
				The exhaustive crypto problem solving program has a set of priorities for the operations that it selects when solving a problem due to design decisions made in the writing of the order two solver. Some sort of order had to be selected, given the nature of the problem. The only alternative to an order would be to randomly assort the order, which has little obvious benefit and adds a lot of
				unnecessary work.
			</p>
			<p>
				The order chosen is particularly interesting because it does not follow the parentheses-exponent-multiplication-division-addition-subtraction scheme laid forth by the popular PEMDAS scheme of operations. Instead the order taken by the author of this order two crypto solver has addition taking first precedence, followed by multiplication, then subtraction, and ending finally with division.
				It is important to note that there is no reason for the order two solver to follow PEMDAS, merely that the arbitrary decision for the order to differ from it was of interest to this program user.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another salient aspect of the order two solution is the way that the operations differ from each other. Addition and multiplication are commutative, meaning that their solution needs only one rule to cover their usage mathematically. Using only one rule though also means that their commutative twin solutions will not get the chance to be used. For instance a problem with the
				numbers (1,2) and a goal of 3 will only ever be solved as (1+2) by this program. Furthermore because subtraction and division are not commutative and therefore require two separate rules in order to completely cover their order two possible solutions. Division also requires ever more work to function properly given that division by zero is undefined by the laws of mathematics. Because of this
				a helper function had to be written to ensure that the number in the denominator is not zero. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The last salient aspect I will discuss is that the nature of the recursion in the crypto solver makes it relatively easy to increase the order of problem that can be solved, provided that every order between the one required and the one currently written is also written. Unfortunately, given my current understanding of Prolog, it does not lend itself to a general solution.
