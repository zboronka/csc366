				CCM Programming Challenge Crypto: Heuristic Document
			</h1>
			<div>Document representing the heuristics that are incorporated into the heuristic problem solver. The representation of each heuristic consists of name composed of a relatively small number of words, an English description, a pseudocode description, and three examples of its application.</div>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Heuristic 1</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Name - Zeros</li>
				<li>English - If the goal is zero and zero is among the numbers, then multiply all of the numbers together.</li>
				<li>Pseudocode - if ((the goal is zero) and (zero is among the numbers)) then [multiply the numbers together]</li>
				<li>Examples</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<ol>
					<li class="code">numbers = {5,4,0,8,9} goal = 0
solution = (5*(4*(0*(8*9))))
					</li>
					<li class="code">numbers = {0,5,3,5,8} goal = 0
solution = (0*(5*(3*(5*8))))
					</li>
					<li class="code">numbers = {7,6,7,1,0} goal = 0
solution = (7*(6*(7*(1*0))))
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

		<section>
			<h2>Heuristic 2</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Name - Number Pair and Zero Goal</li>
				<li>English - If the goal is zero and there is a pair among the numbers, then multiply the difference between the pair of numbers by the product of the remaining numbers.</li>
				<li>Pseudocode - if ((the goal is zero) and (there is a pair among the numbers)) then [multiply the difference between the pair of numbers by the product of the remaining numbers]</li>
				<li>Examples</li>

		<section>
			<h2>Heuristic 3</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Name - Nonzero Goal and Zero Number</li>
				<li>English - If the goal is nonzero and the goal is among the numbers and zero is among the numbers, then add the goal to the product of the remaining numbers.</li>
				<li>Pseudocode - if ((the goal is nonzero) and (the goal is among the numbers) and (zero is among the numbers)) then [add the goal to the product of the remaining numbers]</li>
				<li>Examples</li>
			</ol>

		<section>
			<h2>Heuristic 4</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Name - Pair Add to Goal and Zero Number </li>
				<li>English - If a pair add to the goal and there is a zero in the rest of the numbers, then add the sum of the pair to the product of the remaining numbers.</li>
				<li>Pseudocode - if ((a pair add to the goal) and (there is a zero in the rest of the numbers)) then [add the sum of the pair to the product of the remaining numbers]</li>

			<h2>Heuristic 8</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Name - Goal In Numbers and Pair In Rest </li>
