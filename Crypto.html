				<li> Which two of your solutions do you believe to be most similar? Why? </li>
				<p>Solution 2 and solution 7, because they both use division of a number by itself to get one and then multiply that in order to effectively get rid of two numbers.</p>
				<li> Which one of your solutions do you believe to be most different from all the rest. Why?</li>
				<p>Solution 8 because I like the balance of it's paranthesis the most (they are the most evenly distributed in my eyes).</p>
				<li> Which one of the problems do you think took the longest for you to solve?</li>
				<p>Probably solution 2, because we did solution 1 in class and then I didn't look at it again for a few days and was slow when I initially started the assignment again.</p>
				<li> Translate your solution to problem Number 7 to English -- striving to do so in an appropriately expressive way -- artfully and unambigously.</li>
				<p>Divide 2 by the product of 2 and 1 and multiply the quotient by the difference of 12 and 4.</p>
				<li> In one relatively short paragraph, articulate how you think you go about solving a Crypto problem.</li>
				<p>I think that my brain mostly goes through a hunt-and-peck style algorithm where it randomly chooses two numbers and sees if it can do something interesting with any of the operators applied to them. Interesting here defined as useful in order to get closer to the goal given the other numbers on the table.</p>
